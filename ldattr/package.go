// Package ldattr defines the model for context attribute references used by the LaunchDarkly SDK.
//
// This includes the ldattr.Ref type, which provides a syntax similar to JSON Pointer for
// referencing values either of a top-level context attribute, or of a value within a JSON object
// or JSON array. It also includes constants for the names of some built-in attributes.
